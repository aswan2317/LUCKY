## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice working with JavaScript promises and asynchronous code. The project includes two parts:

1. Fetching and displaying facts about numbers from the Numbers API.
2. Fetching and displaying cards from a deck using the Deck of Cards API.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aswan2317/async-js-exercises.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd async-js-exercises
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser to view the project.

## Usage

- **Number Facts**: Displays facts about specific numbers. The facts are fetched from the Numbers API and displayed on the page.
- **Deck of Cards**: Allows you to draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, a new deck is created. Each time you click the "Draw Card" button, a new card is drawn from the deck and displayed on the page with a random rotation for a realistic look.

## Exercises

### Part 1: Number Facts

1. **Favorite Number Fact**: Fetches a fact about your favorite number.
2. **Multiple Numbers Facts**: Fetches facts about multiple numbers in a single request.
3. **Four Facts About Favorite Number**: Fetches four different facts about your favorite number.

### Part 2: Deck of Cards

1. **Single Card**: Fetches a single card from a newly shuffled deck and logs the card's value and suit.
2. **Two Cards**: Fetches two cards from the same deck and logs the values and suits of both cards.
3. **Draw Cards**: Builds an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. Every time you click the "Draw Card" button, a new card is displayed on the page until there are no cards left in the deck.
